# Inline exercise: Sendgrid outgoing email
## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Goal

Twilio and Sendgrid are two powerful tools that we can use to integrate
telephone (voice calls, SMS) and email into our applications, respectively. You
saw how to send outgoing SMS messages using Twilio's API. Your goal in this
exercise is to send an outgoing email using the Sendgrid API.

## Instructions

1. If you haven't already, [set up your Sendgrid account](../warmup).
1. Take a look at the `skeleton/` directory, which has some very basic
   scaffolding. You'll be writing your code in `skeleton/index.js`, but you'll
   need to run some commands from the commandline too.
1. Install the [sendgrid-nodejs](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs)
   npm module.
1. Follow the instructions on that page to get your Sendgrid API key, then copy
   it into the `skeleton/sendgrid.env` file. Run `source sendgrid.env` at the
   commandline to set the environment variables.
1. Add the code under [Quick
   Start](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs#quick-start) to send your
   first outgoing email. Make sure to replace `to_email` with your email
   address!
1. Run your script from the commandline: `node index.js`.
1. Check your email!
