# Warmup exercise: Sendgrid
## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Goal

Your goal is to create a Sendgrid account, which we will use to send and receive
emails automatically as part of today's lesson and project work.

## What is Sendgrid?

Sendgrid is a cloud-based email service which has both a free tier (we like
free ✌️), and an API that lets us send and receive emails programmatically (from
inside our app). It's a lot like Twilio, but for email instead of telephony.

## Instructions

1. Head to https://app.sendgrid.com/signup in your browser.
1. Fill out the form. Make sure "Free 12k" is selected at the top right corner.
1. Check your email for the confirmation, and tap on the Confirm Email Address
   button.
1. Fill out the second form. Feel free to use the following values:
 - Company Name: Horizons School of Technology
 - Website URL: http://www.joinhorizons.com/
 - Street address: 3701 Chestnut St., Philadelphia, PA 19104

 - What types of email do you plan on sending? Transactional (only)
 - Do you send email on behalf of other companies? No
 - What's your expected monthly email volume? 0 to 40k

If you finish setting up your account and you still have time, get started on
