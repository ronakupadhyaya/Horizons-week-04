# Inline exercise: hashing
## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Goal

Your goal in this exercise is to write a password hashing function that results
in zero or a very small number of collisions among a long list of common
passwords.

## Instructions

Open up `hash.js` in your text editor and `hash.html` in your web browser. There
are instructions inline in `hash.js`: you need to fill in a hash function that
minimizes collisions.
