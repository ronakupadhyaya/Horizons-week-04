# Inline exercise: encryption
## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Goal

Your goal is to devise a cipher that your class cannot break, and to use that
cipher to exchange a secret message with a partner.

## Instructions

Work with another classmate. Come up with a cipher, and agree upon an encryption
key. For instance, you may choose to use a Caesar cipher, and agree that your
key is "+7", i.e., all letters are shifted to the right five places.

One partner should write a secret message using the cipher, and the other
partner should ensure that they can decrypt that message.

At the end of this exercise, as a class we will try to decrypt one of these
messages.
