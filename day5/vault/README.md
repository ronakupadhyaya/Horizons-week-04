# The Vault (pair exercise)

## Contents


## Goal

Your goal is to build a backend webapp that stores top secret sensitive data.
You'll start by building a basic authentication system, then make it more robust
over the course of the project.


## Instructions


## Phase 1. Sessions

We need sessions before we can do anything else. Configure these to be secure.


## Phase 2. Local Strategy

Use the `passwords.json` file. Finish filling out the LocalStrategy passport
strategy so that only authorized users in this file identified by the specified
passwords can login.


## Phase 3. Make sessions persistent

Awesome! It's working! Now let's start making it more robust. Make your sessions
persistent in the database.


## Phase 4. A better strategy

Let's store our users in the database instead, and hash their passwords.
