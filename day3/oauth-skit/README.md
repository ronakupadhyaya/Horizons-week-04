# Inline exercise: OAuth skit
## Time limit: 10 minutes

## Background

The OAuth protocol is extremely important to the modern web app ecosystem, as it
provides a way for web apps to access protected content on behalf of the content
owner _without the user's credentials_.

## Goal

Your goal is to come up with a 60 second skit that demonstrates the basic
concept of the OAuth protocol with two other classmates.

## Instructions

1. Form a group of three with two other classmates. You must work in groups of
   exactly three for this exercise. Within your group, choose roles: one of you
   is a **Student** (hard, right?), one of you is a **University**, and one of
   you is an amazing, hot new web app called **Horizificator**.
1. Amongst yourselves, figure out how to solve this problem:
 - Student has signed up to use Horizificator, an app that downloads Student's
   class schedule and grades and analyzes them to tell Student which classes
   they should take next semester to minimize time spent studying and to
   maximize consumption of PB&J sandwiches.
 - Therefore, Horizificator needs access to Student's class schedule and grades.
 - Student's class schedule and grades are kept by University.
 - University will _only_ grant access to these data to Student, identified by a
   student ID, or to someone holding a letter on official university letterhead
   signed by student authorizing the other person.
 - Student is forbidden from giving their student ID to anyone else.
 - The three parties may only communicate in groups of two at a time.
